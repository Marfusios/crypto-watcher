Once cloned, run the following from a command line to run the app.

``` console
> dotnet restore
> dotnet run
```

You can modify the settings in [appsettings.json](./appsettings.json) to add or remove exchanges and symbols 
you'd like to watch.
Also you can change mode between `PriceChanges` and `L3`. 

After that, you're off to the moon. ðŸš€ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ
